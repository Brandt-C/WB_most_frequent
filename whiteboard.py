# You are given a list of integers. Write a function to find the two numbers that appear the 
# most frequently in the list. If multiple pairs have the same frequency, return the pair with the smallest sum.

# For example, given the list [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4], the function should return the pair [2, 3] 
# because both numbers appear twice, and their sum is smaller than the sums of other pairs with the same frequency.



# Challange: Cannot use the sorted function.
